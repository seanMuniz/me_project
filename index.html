        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Hello! This website is a practice project that demonstrates my skills in programming. 
            I also wanted to share some pictures and my experiences from being in the army. The army
            has definately brought a bunch of experiences that I never thought I would ever encounter.
            I've shot the C7, been in a gas chamber, camped outside, travelled to Halifax, and have met
            many cool people. Who know's where the army will take me next. Anyways, I hope you enjoy the
            content! <br><br>

            <p>
                Being posted to CFB Halifax is an experience that I never expected when
                I first joined the army. I got to visit Peggy's Cove, The Oven's, Macnab
                Island and more! Aside from seeing the beautiful nature, I got to explore 
                the amazing city which has many bar's and restaurants!

            <p>
                I've never been posted at CFB Borden, but I have been there for training. Training
                mainly consists of going to the range, and camping out in the field. I also did my 
                driver wheel course here which consisted of doing off road driving. Digging the MILCOT
                out of the dirt was a fun experience.

            <h2>Toronto</h2>
            <p>
                Being from Toronto, most of my training is done here. I did my basic training in Toronto, 
                and all of my parade nights are in Toronto. Toronto is also where my driver wheel was hosted.
